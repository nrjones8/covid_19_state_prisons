											<p class="standard_font">The New Jersey Department of Corrections (NJDOC) takes the threat of coronavirus (COVID-19) seriously, and in consultation with the Department of Health, has taken proactive measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. These action steps are outlined in the frequently asked questions below.</p>
											
											<table class="table table-striped standard_font" width="100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:1%" class="count">.
													</td>
<td>
<strong>Are staff and incarcerated individuals being screened for COVID-19 before entering an NJDOC facility?</strong>													  <p>Yes. The NJDOC is conducting health screenings of all individuals entering its facilities that includes a temperature scan and subsequent questionnaire detailing recent travel activity and contact with individuals who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
													</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width:1%" class="count">.
													</td>
<td>
<strong>Are inmates provided with masks?</strong>													  <p>Yes, all inmates and residents are provided with surgical masks for use during the COVID-19 pandemic with instructions on proper usage.</p>
													</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="count">.</td>
													<td>
													<b>How is the Department determining who should be quarantined?</b> 
													<p>As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, individuals who have come in contact with a person who has COVID-19 are required to be quarantined for 14 days. Contact is defined as being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for more than 10 minutes. Secondary contacts are not required to quarantine. For example: John has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Mary was in a meeting with John for more than 10 minutes, sitting less than 5 feet away. Mary then had a meeting with Tim, also longer than 10 minutes and sat 4 feet away from John. Under the CDC guidance Mary would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days where Tim would not. 
													</p>
												</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="count">.</td>
													<td>
													<b>Is social distancing being enforced throughout NJDOC facilities?  </b>
												  <p>The Department is taking this issue very seriously and continuously assessing and amending its policies as the CDC and New Jersey Department of Health issue new guidance. The NJDOC is practicing social distancing among its workforce and limiting foot traffic in facilities with the implementation of flexible work arrangements for non-essential personnel that includes a reduced and rotational workforce. As it pertains to the incarcerated, group activities, dining, recreation, religious gatherings, and education have been either suspended or modified to minimize potential exposure and encourage social distancing. For example, individuals are provided access to religious materials and are encouraged to practice their faith in their living quarters. Also, educational programs have been adapted in support of independent study.
													</p>
												</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="count">.</td>
													<td>
													<b>What procedures is the NJDOC using to keep facilities clean?  </b>
													<p>All facilities have enhanced sanitization efforts using bleach. The Department has also increased access to hand sanitizer for staff and soap for inmates, while also educating all on CDC guidance on mitigating the spread of germs.

Each case is to be assessed by an Emergency Medical Review Committee that would make individualized determinations of whether home confinement would better serve an eligible inmate.

Inmates released from the hospital are admitted to infirmary level care at the facility until released by medical staff.
