    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p><strong>Isolation</strong> separates people who have or are showing potential symptoms of a contagious disease or virus, from people who do not.</p>
	<p><strong>Quarantine</strong> separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease or virus to see if they become sick.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is a contact investigation?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>When public health workers investigate whether a  disease has spread, it is called a contact investigation. For COVID-19,  this generally starts with an interview of the person who has tested positive.  Questions are asked such as places they have been and a list of people who may  have had close contact with them. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC considers a close contact</a> someone who was within about six feet of someone  with COVID-19 for a long period or had direct contact with infectious  secretions of a person with coronavirus â such as being coughed on.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Will prisons be equipped with sanitizing stations for inmates?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Yes, all inmates have access to hand soap and water. Hand soap is  available in inmate restrooms. Health items, such as toilet paper and soap, are  replenished as needed. Education has also been issued for inmates instructing  them to wash their hands frequently and follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html">CDC guidelines</a> for the prevention  of the spread of COVID-19.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Will inmates be allowed to use hand sanitizer?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Hand sanitizer is classified as contraband because of the high alcohol  content and the possibility for abuse. All inmates have access to soap and  water. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html">CDC</a> recommends using  soap and water, and only when that is not available, hand sanitizer.</p>

    <!-- Accordion tab title -->
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Have you tested any inmates?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Yes. However,  that is an evolving number. With more than 24,000 staff and approximately  93,000 inmates, testing numbers are constantly changing. FDC is committed to  providing accurate data regarding the <strong>number  of positive COVID-19 cases</strong> within the inmate population and within the  employee sector that has contact with the inmate or offender population.</p>
            <p>A  medical professional, in consultation with the county health department, determines  which inmates are tested for COVID-19. If an inmate begins experiencing  symptoms indicative of COVID-19, FDC medical staff will immediately engage with  the county health department.</p>

            <p>FDC has implemented  enhanced screening protocols for all employees, contract staff and any others  who enter any correctional institution.</p>
            <p>Anyone, including staff,  will be denied entry if they:</p>
            <ul>
<li>Have  traveled internationally, to an area with substantial community spread (such as  Louisiana, Connecticut, New York or New Jersey) or on a cruise within the last  14 days.</li>

              <li>Have  had contact with someone who has COVID-19 or is currently under DOH  investigation for COVID-19.</li>
            </ul>
<p>If a corrections officer  or other institution staff member or contractor fails screening, they will be  denied access to the correctional institution and will be required to have  documentation from a medical professional that they are cleared to return to work.  Their medical professional would determine if testing is required.</p>
            <p>FDC employees may use  accrued personal leave (sick, annual, personal, comp) if they are unable to  telework during self-isolation or quarantine following close contact with an  individual who has been confirmed positive for COVID-19.

    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Medical professionals, in consultation with the  county health department, determine which inmates are tested for COVID-19. If  an inmate begins experiencing symptoms indicative of COVID-19, FDC will  immediately engage with DOH. FDC and DOH communicate as to the best process for  collecting samples from any symptomatic inmate. </p>
            <p>FDCâs infectious  disease protocols are flexible to account for changes during this evolving  health emergency. FDC Office of Health Services and our agency medical  contractor are prepared to and currently conduct sample collection when  necessary. DOH will conduct all tests it deems necessary, based on the  information provided by the inmateâs treating clinician.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>In the case of a positive test result for COVID-19,  FDC, in coordination with the county health department, initiates contact  investigations and isolation and quarantine measures are taken in accordance  with FDCâs infectious disease protocols, CDC and DOH recommendations. </p>
            <p>An inmateâs treating clinician at the  institution manages his or her care and can assess the needs of the patient as  the care plan evolves. If an inmate needs outside medical care, they will  receive it. FDC medical facilities are more extensive and complete than an  outside general practitioner facility and include an infirmary, FDC hospital,  pharmacy services and in-patient care units. </p>
            <p>Ensuring inmates  incarcerated in Floridaâs prisons receive all necessary medical and behavioral  treatment is one of FDCâs core constitutional responsibilities. FDC assures an  appropriate level of health care is provided to all inmates and FDCâs medical  provider is held accountable for care in line with evolving national standards.</p>

      <p>FDC does not have the legal authority to release inmates prior to  completion of their sentence. FDC ensures inmates serve their court-ordered  sentence in accordance with Florida law. Information regarding conditional  medical release can be found on the website of the <a href="https://www.fcor.state.fl.us/postrelease.shtml">Florida Commission on Offender Review</a>.</p>

      <p>FDC has modified inmate movement within institutions to limit the amount  of social mixing between groups of inmates.

      <p>Specific guidance related  to pregnancy and COVID-19 from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html">CDC</a> is limited at this time. Education for inmates has been  issued instructing them to wash their hands frequently and follow CDC  guidelines for the prevention of the spread of infections:<strong></strong></p>
            <ul>
<li>Avoid  touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
              <li>Cover  your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow, then throw the tissue in the  trash.</li>
              <li>Wash  your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after  going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or  sneezing.</li>
              <li>Let  a member of the staff know if you or someone you know has symptoms including a  fever and cough or shortness of breath.</li>
            </ul>
<p>FDC has an outbreak management plan and has implementedÂ measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.  All state prisons and facilities are bolstering response readiness by educating  and encouraging social distancing and initiating additional cleaning measures.</p>

      <p>Inmates assigned to work release will continue their work assignments. Inmates have been advised regarding CDC guidelines for social distancing, hand washing and increased cleaning. Upon returning to the facility after their work assignment, inmates will undergo screening for entrance into the facility. If an inmate fails the screening protocol, they will be placed in a separated area to avoid possible transmission of COVID-19 to other inmates and staff and immediately be referred to FDCâs Health Services.</p>

      <p>FDC Community Corrections officers are working with offenders on supervision to adjust reporting schedules to minimize congregating at probation offices and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
