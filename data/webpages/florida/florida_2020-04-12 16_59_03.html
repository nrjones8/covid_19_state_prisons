          <p>The Florida Department of Corrections (FDC), in  conjunction with Florida Department of Health (DOH) and the Florida Division of  Emergency Management (FDEM), are closely monitoring developments associated  with COVID-19. FDC is prepared to handle any potential cases of COVID-19 within  the state-operated correctional institutions in Florida. </p>

<a name="testing"></a>Information on Testing</h2>
            <p>The county health department provides guidance to determine  which inmates are tested for COVID-19. If an inmate begins experiencing  symptoms indicative of COVID-19, FDC will immediately engage with the county  health department and the inmate will be placed in medical isolation, pending  DOH testing.</p>
<p>If  a staff member presents with any symptoms of illness, they have been instructed  not to report to work and contact their health care provider. These staff will  not be permitted to return to work until they have been cleared by a medical  professional.</p>
			<h2>
<a name="staff"></a>Information Regarding Correctional Institution Staff</h2>
            <p>In order to protect the personal health  information of these individuals, FDC will not identify the name or occupation  of the employees at these facilities. Staff listed above may be employed by FDC  or one of its contractors. Any employee who is symptomatic, or who has tested  positive for COVID-19, will not be allowed entry to a correctional institution.  The employee will not be allowed to return to work until a full recovery is  documented by a medical professional and DOH and CDC guidelines are followed.  Additional questions regarding these individuals (gender, age, travel status)  should be directed to the Florida DOH.</p>
            <h2>
<a name="cc"></a>Information on Offenders on Probation</h2>

<a name="response"></a>FDC Response to Confirmed Positive COVID-19 Cases</h2>
            <p>FDC’s Office of Health Services, institutional medical staff  and institutional operations staff work hand-in-hand with the Florida DOH to  quickly engage and resolve infectious disease outbreaks as soon as they occur.

            <ul>
<li>If an inmate presents to medical with symptoms  indicative of COVID-19, medical staff will place the inmate in medical  isolation, pending DOH testing.</li>
              <li>With every potential and/or positive case of  COVID-19, FDC works closely with the local health department to conduct a  trace-back contact investigation and determine if additional staff or inmates  need to be tested due to close contact risk factors. This investigation will  also determine the need to place inmates on varying levels of restricted  movement.</li>
              <li>Staff members who test positive for COVID-19  will not return to work until a full recovery is documented by a medical  professional and DOH and CDC guidelines are followed.</li>
              <li>If it is determined that a COVID-19 positive  employee has not had contact with the inmate population, the inmates will not  be placed in medical quarantine.</li>
              <li>Symptomatic inmates will be placed in medical  isolation, and FDC will immediately engage with the county health department.  The county health department will make a determination on testing. </li>
              <li>The inmate will not be allowed to move in and  out of their dormitories until they have been medically cleared by an onsite  medical professional. </li>
              <li>Only essential staff will be allowed to enter  the institution and no inmates will transfer in or out. </li>
