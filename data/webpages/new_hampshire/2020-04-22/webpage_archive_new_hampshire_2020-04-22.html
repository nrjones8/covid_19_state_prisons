				      <p class="boldcenter">Thank you to our staff and residents for continuing to go above and beyond to keep our facilities clean and safe! All of your hard work is appreciated!</p>
				      <p class="boldcenter"><img src="images/cleaning-for-public_000.jpg" width="300" height="231" alt="Photo of staff and residents cleaning at our facilities"></p>
				      <p class="boldcenter">COVID-19 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</p>
				      <p><span class="bold">Does the NHDOC operate the county jails or federal prisons?</span></p>
				      <p>No, the NHDOC has jurisdiction over the New Hampshire State  Prison for Men (NHSP-M), the New Hampshire Correctional Facility for Women  (NHCFW), the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility (NNHCF), the  Transitional Work Center (TWC) and the Transitional Housing Units (Calumet,  North End and Shea Farm). County jails are operated by the individual counties.  Federal prisons are operated by the federal government – Bureau of prisons. For  more information on the counties in the State of New Hampshire, go to <a href="https://www.nhcounties.org/" class="link">www.nhcounties.org/</a>.  For  more information on the federal prisons, go to <a href="https://www.bop.gov/" class="link">https://www.bop.gov/</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">How is the NHDOC keeping the facilities sanitized?</span></p>
				      <p>The Department has always been regimented in keeping facilities sanitized. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) we began in early March, at all NHDOC facilities, to engage in additional sanitization measures above the already elevated measures in place due to cold and flu season. We ensured the disinfectant used in all our facilities - in addition to bleach - is effective against COVID-19.</p>
				      <p><span class="bold">What are the steps in place if staff or residents show signs of COVID-19?</span></p>
				      <p>If a staff member shows any symptom of COVID 19 - fever, cough, shortness of breath - or indicates on the screening form they have been in contact with anyone who has COVID-19 or has recently traveled based on CDC guidance, that staff member will be directed to go home and </p>
				      <p>a. call their healthcare provider or <br>
			          b. call their HR representative if they do not have symptoms but need to quarantine due to close contact or travel. </p>
				      <p>Residents who show any sign of COVID-19 will be isolated and will be attended to by a medical staff member. </p>
				      <p><span class="bold">Who will receive face masks? </span></p>
				      <p>Staff, will be provided and required at a minimum to wear a fabric face covering during their full duty shift. This is not required if they are working a solitary post (e.g. perimeter, single post control room).</p>
				      <p>Surgical masks will be used for any resident who is symptomatic of COVID-19. Residents with confirmed COVID-19 who are outside of their designated isolation unit, or in the presence of any staff member treating or escorting them.  Fabric face coverings can be substituted for surgical masks in the above scenarios when surgical mask supplies are not available.  N95 masks are to be used by medical staff with residents who are confirmed positive of COVID-19 residents, or suspected COVID-19 residents during assessment and treatment. </p>
				      <p><span class="bold">What are the requirements for administrative home confinement (AHC) during the COVID-19 crisis? </span></p>
				      <p>The requirements for AHC have not changed. Residents must  meet all requirements of <a href="../policies/documents/805-01-ahc.pdf" class="link">PPD 805.01</a> <img src="../images/icon_pdf.gif" width="18" height="16" alt="">for consideration. The PPD is available to residents on their tablets.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Can residents be released on medical parole?</span></p>
				      <p>In accordance with <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXII/651-A/651-A-10-a.htm" class="link">RSA 651-A:10-a</a>, the Commissioner and the Director of Medical and Forensic services may recommend to the Adult Parole Board, individuals who meet the conditions for medical parole. </p>
				      <p> <span class="bold">How is the NHDOC engaging in physical distancing? </span></p>
				      <p>The Department has implemented the recommendations as outlined by the CDC for Correctional and Detention Facilities and made operational adjustments accordingly to include but not limited to:					    </p>
				      <ul>
<li>Increased space between individuals waiting in lines and waiting areas, adjusting locations of waiting to larger spaces, moved furniture apart when not affixed to the floor.</li>
				        <li>Created recreational opportunities where individuals can spread out.</li>
				        <li>Stagger time in recreation spaces and schedule them by living unit.</li>
				        <li>Reduce number allowed in groups at one time to 10 or under.</li>
				        <li>Adjusted meal times and movements.</li>
				        <li>Implemented alternatives as appropriate to existing group activities.</li>
				        <li>Rearrange schedule movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas.</li>
				      </ul>
<p><span class="bold">What is being done for the medically higher-risk residents in custody? </span></p>
				      <p>In addition to increasing sanitization within facilities, staff are amplifying efforts to both monitor and reduce potential exposure and transmission of the virus. Individuals who demonstrate symptoms will be provided with PPE as medically directed, and either quarantined, medically isolated, or transferred to a hospital. A medical team has identified higher-risk residents and cell-feeds are being provided to these residents. </p>
				      <p><br><span class="bold">Does the NHDOC have a plan to quarantine individuals should there be a positive case in any of the facilities? </span></p>
				      <p>Yes, the facilities have plans in place if we have positive  or suspected cases of COVID-19 to engage in medical isolation or quarantine as  appropriate to the case. Frequent drills are occurring in the facilities to  ensure staff know how to respond. </p>
<p><span class="bold">What steps are you taking to protect staff and residents? </span></p>
				      <p>The NHDOC is taking every precaution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our facilities. Including but not limited to: </p>
				      <ul>
<li>Providing COVID-19 screenings including temperature checks of all individuals entering NHDOC prison facilities and the Secure Psychiatric Unit.</li>
				        <li>Enhancing sanitization and providing employees and residents access to sanitization products</li>
				        <li>Adhering to the CDC's physical distancing guidelines in prison activities </li>
				        <li>Restricting transfers from other correctional facilities</li>
				        <li>Suspending visitations and volunteers</li>
				        <li>Converted to digital parole hearings				        
				          <blockquote>

				          </blockquote>
				        </li>
			          </ul>
<p><span class="bold">Is the NHDOC looking at national trends in corrections for guidance?</span></p>
				    <p>The NHDOC has aligned with CDC guidelines. We are also monitoring NH DHHS publications and other public health resources to assist us in making quick and responsive operational adjustments with a focus on the health and wellness of our staff and residents.</p>
