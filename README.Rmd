## What's in this repo?
The goal of covid_19_state_prisons is to automate the collection of data from various state Department of Corrections into one repository. Specifically, we focused on collecting data related to the number of people who have been tested for NCoV-19 within state correctional facilities as well as historical data regarding state facilities. As a result, this repo has data pertaining to the following

- Number of incarcerated people tested in correctional facilities by state (If data is available by the state's  DOC)
- Number of incarcerated people who tested positive for NCoV-19 in correctional facilities by state 
- Number of incarcerated people who tested negative for NCoV-19 in correctional facilities by state
- Historical Population data for state prisons (if available).
- Web scrapers built to extract data from varying state DOCs

While we make every effort to ensure that the information scraped is accurate and updated everyday, there are the following caveats. First, not all state DOC's update their information everyday or even every business day. As a result, while the scraper for data pertaining to NCoV-19 is run daily, the data retrieved by the scraper may not reflect daily changes. While we make every effort to ensure that states who do not update their covid data daily are clearly marked, this all ultimately depends on the frequency that a state's department of correction updates their data.
